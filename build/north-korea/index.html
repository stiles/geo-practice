            <h2>North Korea clues</h2>
            <ul class="clue-list">
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Language:</strong>
                    <p>Korean (Hangul), known as 조선말 (Chosŏnmal) in North Korea. The alphabet consists of 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowels, with additional compound characters.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Cars:</strong>
                    <p>Vehicle registration plates are usually white with black letters, showing a combination of numbers and the province code. Plates often feature a simple design with minimal graphics.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Driving:</strong>
                    <p>Vehicles drive on the right side of the road.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Signs:</strong>
                    <p>Road signs are primarily in Hangul, with a simple and utilitarian design. Few signs are present, and they often lack the colorful graphics seen in other countries.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Environment:</strong>
                    <p>The landscape features mountainous terrain, forests, and rivers, with agricultural fields in some areas. Urban areas may show stark contrasts due to limited development.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Infrastructure:</strong>
                    <p>Architecture is characterized by grandiose government buildings, monuments, and utilitarian structures. Notable styles include socialist realism and distinctive Pyongyang architecture.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Culture:</strong>
                    <p>Statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are common, as well as propaganda murals and posters. Public spaces are often quite organized and may lack the vibrancy seen in other countries.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonus:</strong>
                    <p>The presence of military installations, lack of consumer goods, and unique state-run public transportation systems can be indicators. Limited internet and access to information can also be discerned.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Flag:</strong>
                    <p>The flag consists of three horizontal stripes: red at the top and bottom, with a blue stripe in the middle. A white circle with a red star is situated on the left side of the blue stripe.</p>
