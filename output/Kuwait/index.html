                    <p>Arabic is the official language. The Arabic alphabet is used, which has special characters such as ح, خ, and ع.</p>

                <li>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Signs:</strong>
                    <p>Road signs are primarily in Arabic, often accompanied by English translations. Signs may feature a combination of green and white for direction and informational signs.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Environment:</strong>
                    <p>Kuwait has a mostly flat desert landscape with coastal areas along the Arabian Gulf. Sand dunes and sparse vegetation are common.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Infrastructure:</strong>
                    <p>Modern architecture is prevalent, with a mix of traditional Islamic designs. Notable buildings include the Kuwait Towers and the Grand Mosque.</p>

                <li>
